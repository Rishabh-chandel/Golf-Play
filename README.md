## Repository Structure

- `client/` - React frontend
- `server/` - Express API and MongoDB models
- `README.md` - project guide and deployment steps

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- MongoDB connection string
- Stripe secret and price IDs if you want subscription flows enabled

## Local Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

Install the root package first, then install dependencies in each app:

```bash
npm install
cd server
npm install

cd ../client
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create or update the environment files in both apps.

Backend variables typically include:

```bash
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=your_monthly_price_id
STRIPE_ANNUAL_PRICE_ID=your_annual_price_id
```

Frontend variables typically include:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. Seed the database

The seed script creates demo charities, users, subscriptions, scores, draws, winners, notifications, and audit data.

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

### 4. Run the app locally

From the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That starts:
- Backend on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

To run either app on its own:

```bash
cd server
npm run dev

cd ../client
npm run dev
```

## Test Credentials

These credentials are already seeded in the database:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | admin@example.com | password123 |
| Player | john@example.com | password123 |
| Player | emma@example.com | password123 |

Notes:
- Admin login requires the Admin role to be selected on the login screen.
- Player accounts require the Player role to be selected.
- Use these accounts for reviewer testing.

- Player dashboard and score submission
- Charity selection
- Draw results and winnings
- Notifications dropdown
